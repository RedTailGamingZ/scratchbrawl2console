Welcome to Scratch Brawl 2: Console Edition!

for some reason the file is too big, so you have to download it and open it. :(

You can connect your own gaming controllers to it to play! Just make sure you set the controls correctly.



Added mods! The mods are as follows:

Random, Shotgun Only, All Minis, Swordfighting, Buzz, Clear
